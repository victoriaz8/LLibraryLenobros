General PseudoCode for Parsing Student Profiles

Process to parse through correctly, semester by semester and not a line at a time
•	Start at the first of student(indicated by the GWID)
•	Store the index of the line started at
•	Parse through the students text file, only taking the String from index 0 to 55 of each line
•	When reached end of student's file(indicated by End of Document), 
go back to the index of the line that the student's profile started on, 
parsing through the string obtained from index 56 to end of line

Finding GWID Number
•	Once the string "GWid" is found, the String 9 indexes later is where 
the G started in the GWID and so we can store everything from the indexes 
of 9 after GWid to 17 after. When we find a GWid, we set a boolean = false 
so that no GWid is captured after this to prevent from storing the same person 
multiple times, so when "END OF DOCUMENT" is found, the boolean is then turned 
to true and the program will continue to search for GWid's

Name
•	When found "Record of", 2 indexes after "of" will start the name, and 
we set a string equal to the name until two spaces are found, indicating
that the name is finished

Writing and Skills Requirement
•	If "skills requirement met" is found, parse for the class number
afterwards indicated by the parantheses
•	Store course numbers that are given on the text file in a variable, 
so it can be checked at the end for completion. If variable is not empty, 
then input "satisfied" in excel for that requirement

Semesters
•	If found "Fall" or "Summer" or "Spring", store the semester and then an
indexes later take in the 4 index long year and put the two together, keep 
searching the start of the following lines until a white space is not found,
if the following 3 characters are not law, then pass over, else take in the
Course number found 2 indexes later and if the four digit long number is equal
to one of the numbers in the courses required list, then take the letter grade
which is 34 digits letter and place it in the correct semester slot created in 
the excel document, continue this search until "Ehrs" is found, which indicates 
that the classes are done being listed, find the number after Ehrs and use it to
calculate the Enrollment Units, which is stored into the semester class that is
in turn stored into the student class

Skills Requirement
We could create a semester class that would be composed of enrollment credits,
credit hours, and the specific semester; We could also create a Student class 
that would be composed of GWid, student's name, an array of semesters that they 
have been through, etc. At the end after all of the student objects are made, 
we run through them to extract the information and place the corresponding info
into the correct excel cell, could make functions to calculate the enrollments
